# Flappy Bird
A flappy bird game coded in [Replit](https://replit.com)

## Game
You can play the game [here](https://skelly1301.github.io/Flappy-Bird/)

If you would like to edit the code in an IDE (I highly recomend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) or [Replit](https://replit.com)), then download the .zip file, if the one in the repo doesn't work, or you would like to see the contents before downloading, use the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1giYjw8w1HOR2g6BpZtg4-zdm7WaUxKQO/view?usp=sharing) link

## Visuals
Here is what the game looks like in a browser:
